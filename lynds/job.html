        <h1>FUTURE JOB</h1>
        <p>For my future job, I would really want to be a game developer or programmer. Since I was a kid, I've always played video games and up until now has been my favourite past time / hobby. I've always wanted to know how are games made and what it takes to become a developer for these games. Since I realized that being in IT can give me the knowledge I need to possibly enter the industry and someday create my own games. Otherwise, if I would not be able succeed in that endeavor, I would like to be a database developer. From what I know, it is a very lucrative part of the industry and is in demand, while at the same time, possibly have less workload than other types of developer. I would be able to be paid an adequate salary for a comfortable life while simply managing a database. My third option if the last two doesn't work out for one reason or another, is going to be a front end developer. Creating user interfaces and experiences are quite an enjoyable experiece to me and wouldn't mind that being my job for any company. </p>
